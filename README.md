## Mindful Skeptic

Is it possible to be a skeptic and truly change? We believe it is, and we're on a beautifully weird mission to prove it. Over the following months we'll be publishing video interviews of people who work in the healing arts and/or are on the path of change. And after that, stay tuned.
